-
Profiling group to measure memory bandwidth drawn by all cores of a socket.
Since this group is based on Uncore events it is only possible to measure on a
per socket base.
The group provides almost accurate results for the total bandwidth
and data volume.
The metric formulas contain a correction factor of (4.0/num_numadomains) to
return the value for all 4 memory controllers in NPS1 mode. This is probably
a work-around. Requested info from AMD but no answer.

Be aware that despite the events imply a traffic direction (FROM and TO), the events
cannot be used to differentiate between read and write traffic. The events will be
renamed to avoid that confusion in the future.
