Formulas:
CPI = PM_RUN_CYC / PM_RUN_INST_CMPL
Stall cycles = PM_CMPLU_STALL
Stall cycles by load/store unit = PM_CMPLU_STALL_LSU
Stall ratio by load/store unit [%] = PM_CMPLU_STALL_LSU/PM_CMPLU_STALL*100.0
Stall cycles by pipeline flush = PM_CMPLU_STALL_FLUSH
Stall ratio by pipeline flush [%] = PM_CMPLU_STALL_FLUSH/PM_CMPLU_STALL*100.0
Stall cycles by branch unit = PM_CMPLU_STALL_BRU
Stall ratio by branch unit [%] = PM_CMPLU_STALL_BRU/PM_CMPLU_STALL*100.0
