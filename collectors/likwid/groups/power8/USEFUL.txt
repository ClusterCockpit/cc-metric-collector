Formulas:
CPI = PM_RUN_CYC / PM_RUN_INST_CMPL
Useful instr. rate = PM_RUN_INST_CMPL/PM_INST_DISP*100.0
Useful uops rate = PM_IOPS_CMPL/PM_IOPS_DISP*100.0

This groups measures how many of the dispatched instructions and internal operations (uops) are
acutally completed. These metrics show the speculatively dispatches instructions compared to the
completed instructions.
