Formulas:
CPI = CPU_CYCLES/INST_SPEC
FP operation pipeline A busy rate [%] = (FLA_VAL/CPU_CYCLES)*100.0
FP pipeline A active element rate [%] = (FLA_VAL_PRD_CNT/(FLA_VAL*16))*100.0
FP operation pipeline B busy rate [%] = (FLB_VAL/CPU_CYCLES)*100.0
FP pipeline B active element rate [%] = (FLB_VAL_PRD_CNT/(FLB_VAL*16))*100.0
-
FLx_VAL: This event counts valid cycles of FLx pipeline.
FLx_VAL_PRD_CNT: This event counts the number of 1's in the predicate bits of
                 request in FLA pipeline, where it is corrected so that it
                 becomes 16 when all bits are 1.
So each predicate mask has 16 slots, so there are 16 slots per cycle in FLA and
FLB. FLA is partly used by other instructions like SVE stores.
