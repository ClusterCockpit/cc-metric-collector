METRICS
Runtime (RDTSC) [s] time
CPI  PMC5/PMC4
Branch rate   (PMC1)/PMC4
Branch misprediction rate  PMC3/PMC4
Branch misprediction ratio  PMC3/(PMC1)
Instructions per branch  PMC4/(PMC1)
Operations per branch PMC2/PMC1

LONG
Formulas:
Branch rate = PM_BR_PRED/PM_RUN_INST_CMPL
Branch misprediction rate =  PM_BR_MPRED_CMPL/PM_RUN_INST_CMPL
Branch misprediction ratio = PM_BR_MPRED_CMPL/PM_BR_PRED
Instructions per branch = PM_RUN_INST_CMPL/PM_BR_PRED
-
The rates state how often in average a branch or a mispredicted branch occured
per instruction retired in total. The Branch misprediction ratio sets directly
into relation what ratio of all branch instruction where mispredicted.
Instructions per branch is 1/Branch rate.
